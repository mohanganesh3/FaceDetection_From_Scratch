# Face Detection From Scratch üë§üîç
The Face Detection From Scratch project aims to build a comprehensive face detection system utilizing fundamental machine learning and computer vision techniques. This project offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of face detection by implementing the entire process from the ground up. By leveraging custom samples and employing tools like OpenCV and LabelMe for data labeling, the project provides a hands-on experience in understanding how facial recognition systems operate and can be trained effectively.

# üöÄ Key Features

	‚Ä¢	Custom Face Detection: Implement face detection using your own labeled samples.
	‚Ä¢	Data Labeling: Utilize OpenCV and LabelMe for labeling face images.
	‚Ä¢	Transfer Learning: Leverage VGG16 for efficient model training and improved accuracy.
	‚Ä¢	Visualization: Display detected faces in images for better understanding.
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook: A detailed notebook (FaceDetection.ipynb) that covers the implementation process.

# üß† How It Works

	1.	Data Collection:
	‚Ä¢	Collect and prepare your own samples for face detection.
	2.	Data Labeling:
	‚Ä¢	Use OpenCV and LabelMe to annotate the images, marking the faces for training.
	3.	Model Training:
	‚Ä¢	Implement the VGG16 architecture for transfer learning.
	‚Ä¢	Train the model on your labeled dataset to recognize and detect faces.
	4.	Visualization:
	‚Ä¢	Visualize the detected faces by drawing bounding boxes around them in the input images.

# üîß Usage

	1.	Jupyter Notebook:
	‚Ä¢	Run FaceDetection.ipynb to follow along with the implementation and visualize the face detection results.
